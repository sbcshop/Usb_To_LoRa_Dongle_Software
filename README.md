## How To use

For windows you can use XCTU or Tera Term and other related software. Among all,XCTU is good and easy to use. follow the below steps

### Lora GUI For Configuration (run with the help of GUI)

 Follow the steps to configure the Lora module:-

 #### Step 1: Setup lora in configuration mode, for this you need to short M0 and open M1 as shown in figure. In case of LoRa Dongle find the mode selection jumper in that board and remove M1 jumper for config mode.
